# challenge-week-01
A webpage titled "Horiseon Social Solution Services" features a navigation menu in the header, a hero image, various sections, and more. This project is the first challenge of the coding bootcamp and utilizes skills in HTML, CSS and Git. Being an odd week challenge, this is an on-the-job-ticket style challenge requiring code refactoring.
